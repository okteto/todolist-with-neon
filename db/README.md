[Neon](https://neon.tech/) is a fully managed serverless Postgres with a generous free tier. Neon separates compute and storage to offer modern developer features such as autoscaling, branching, bottomless storage, and more.

You can use it together with Okteto to give your team one-click access to development environments that look like production, data included!
